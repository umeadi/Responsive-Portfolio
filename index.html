                        Greetings! My name is Marlon Umeadi, and I'm an underwriter at Regions bank. The primary role of an underwriter is to utilize consumer lending laws and policies to make decisions on home equity loan applications. Prior to being an underwriter, I had the advantage of working in the front office. Underwriting is a back office role, so my background has given me a unique exposure to both sides of the bank. Banking and finance are vast worlds that are constantly evolving. This makes maintaining a presense in the digital age a top priority for financial institutions.

                        One of my goals from this bootcamp is to combine my background in finance with web development. I'm hoping this will allow me to transition into a role that allows me to tap into my creativity. When I'm not underwriting applications, and sharpening my web development skills I'm a dad of 13 houseplants. I also like to stay physically active with yoga, boxing, and calisthenics. I instruct calisthenics classes 3 days a week during the warmer months. Upon completion of the Trilogy Code Bootcamp, I plan on delving more into my yoga practice.
